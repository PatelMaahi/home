			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
			Reptiles are one of the most fascinating and diverse groups of animals on our planet. 
			With a history dating back hundreds of millions of years, they have adapted and thrived 
			through a wide range of environments, from deserts to rainforests, and from freshwater 
			to the depths of the ocean. Reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles, and 
			even dinosaurs! On this website, we will take a look at some of the most interesting 
			and beautiful reptiles on our planet. But first…
			</p>
		  
			<h2>Overview of Reptiles</h2>
			<p>
			Reptiles are known for their scaly skin, which provides them with protection and reduces 
			water loss. Reptiles, unlike mammals, are ectothermic, which means they depend on outside 
			heat sources to maintain body temperature. This enables them to preserve energy and be 
			very flexible in their surroundings. Unlike other vertebrates (animals that have a backbone), 
			reptiles have the ability to lay shelled eggs on land, due to their adaptions. Around 310–320 
			million years ago, reptiles first appeared in the late Carboniferous period's steamy wetlands.
			The earliest known reptiles have traits with contemporary reptiles, such as tiny, scaly bodies.

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2">Squamata</td>
					<td>Snakes</td>
					<td>Snakes are long limbless creatures covered with scales on their body,with sizes 
					ranging anywhere between a couple inches to several feet long. They have various different 
					colours and patterns on their body depending on the species. They can be found in diverse 
					habitats including forests, grasslands, deserts, and aquatic environments. Species like 
					the anacondas and pythons generally grow to be one of the longest species of snakes. Their 
					diet generally consists of rodents, birds, insects, and sometimes other snakes.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Lizards</td>
					<td>Lizards are known for their incredible ability to detach their tails. They can be found 
					in habitats such as, forests, deserts, grasslands, and urban areas. They come in a wide range
					of sizes between the length of a fingertip, to several feet long, as well as various colours.
					They generally feed on invertabrates like insects, and plants. Iguanas and Geckos are also 
					types of lizards.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2">Crocodilia</td>
					<td>Crocodiles</td>
					<td>Crocodiles are large reptiles that have a tough scaly body. They are known for their powerful
					jaws, big teeth and their ability to annihilate a prey within minutes. They feed on fish, birds,
					mammals, and occasionaly humans. They are considered apex predators, and genrally live in swampy 
					areas.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Alligators</td>
					<td>Alligators are basically the same as crocodiles, except their physical features differ from 
					crocodiles.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Testudines</td>
					<td>Turtles</td>
					<td>Turtles are known for their shells, and distinct features from oher reptiles. They come in a
					wide range on sizes, and live in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Their diet generally consists
					of vegatation, fruits, insects, worms, fish, and small aquatic animals.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Archosaurs</td>
					<td>Dinosaurs</td>
					<td>Dinosaurs were a group of distinct animals that roamed the Earth around the Mesozoic Era. Although
					we don't know much ablut them, they are fascinating creatures.</td>
